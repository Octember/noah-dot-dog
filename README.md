# noah-dot-dog


Some Ideas:

"Hello, and welcome to Noah.gov"

...

"Use the arrow keys or mouse to guide the doge towards greatness"

...

Navigate a maze, bounce off walls... Get to the destination

OR

Shoot bubbles at pillows that block your path. 

OR 

something like pool?



Good UX for what the goal is.
